# Zphisher-Phishing-Simulation-Project

## **Overview**
This project is a simulation of phishing attacks using the open-source tool Zphisher. The aim is to educate users and organizations about phishing tactics and demonstrate how attackers exploit such methods. By understanding these attacks, individuals can take better precautions and implement effective security measures to protect sensitive information.

## **Disclaimer**
**This project is for educational purposes only.** It is intended to raise awareness about phishing and improve cybersecurity defenses. Misuse of this tool for malicious purposes is illegal and unethical. The author is not responsible for any misuse of the information provided in this repository.

## **Objectives**
- Simulate phishing attacks to demonstrate how attackers create convincing fake login pages.
- Analyze how attackers capture credentials through phishing techniques.
- Highlight preventive measures to protect against phishing attempts.

## **Key Features**
- Demonstrates phishing templates for 33 popular websites, including Facebook, Instagram, Google, and others.
- Shows step-by-step creation of a phishing page.
- Captures and logs credentials entered on the phishing page for analysis (simulation only).

## **Steps Performed**
1. **Tool Setup**
   - Configured Zphisher to simulate phishing scenarios.
   - Selected Instagram as the target website for demonstration.

2. **Phishing Page Creation**
   - Chose the "Traditional Login Page" option.
   - Generated a phishing link that mimics the Instagram login page.

3. **Phishing Simulation**
   - Entered dummy credentials into the fake login page.
   - Observed how Zphisher captured and logged the credentials for analysis.
